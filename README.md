# apriori_algo
This respo contains a simple project based upon apriori algo used in ML.This model is basically used in sensing the consumer behaviour towards a particular item or product.This model tells us if any product is related to other.For eg-cusomers usually buy milk and bread together.This reveals that there is some sort of co-relation between bread and milk.Apriori algo helps us finding such relation between products.
In this respo apriori.py is the program and apryori.py is used to import essential libraries for our task.Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv is our data on which we perform our task and get the result.
